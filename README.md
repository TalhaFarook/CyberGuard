In this project, I leverage the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to predict whether a given text can be classified as offensive. Furthermore, I aim to identify the specific type of offensive content, such as those related to age, gender, religion, and race.

My approach combines advanced techniques from NLP and ML to analyze text data and extract meaningful patterns. By utilizing a diverse range of features and applying powerful algorithms, I can accurately classify offensive texts and categorize them according to the different dimensions of offensiveness.

The data folder contains all the lists, I have gathered during my research. It also contains the database file, which contains all the data given, for you ease so you can continue the work without any difficulty.
